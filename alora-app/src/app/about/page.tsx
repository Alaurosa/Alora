            <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-2">Menstrual Phase</h3>
            <p>The phase when menstruation occurs, typically lasting 3-7 days. Energy levels may be lower, and the body is shedding the uterine lining.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div className="card border-l-4 border-follicular">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-2">Follicular Phase</h3>
            <p>Following menstruation until ovulation, lasting about 7-10 days. Energy levels begin to rise, and the body prepares for potential pregnancy.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div className="card border-l-4 border-ovulatory">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mb-2">Ovulatory Phase</h3>
            <p>The release of an egg from the ovary, typically occurring around day 14 of a 28-day cycle. Energy and confidence levels are often at their peak.</p>
